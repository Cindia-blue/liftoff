Script 1: Team-wide Self Introduction or Kickoff Statement

Hi everyone, I’m Cindy, and I’m really excited to be joining the team.
I’ve spent the past few years working across cloud infrastructure, runtime systems, and platform observability—most recently at Airbnb and before that at Salesforce and VMware.

My main focus has been on container runtime performance, storage lifecycle, and debugging complex production issues across distributed systems. I’m especially interested in the intersection between system reliability and cost efficiency.

One of the reasons I joined Pinterest is because I see this as a place where strong infrastructure work connects directly with product value and user impact.

In the first few weeks, I’ll focus on understanding our container lifecycle architecture, particularly areas around snapshot, blob management, and runtime configuration.

I’m also really looking forward to learning from all of you—this team has a lot of domain depth and I’m here to contribute but also grow.

Feel free to reach out if you think there’s a corner of the system I should deep dive into early, or if there’s something I can help with.



Today, I reviewed a set of critical Pull Requests from the containerd project, focusing on the snapshot lifecycle, blob management, and content usage instrumentation. These PRs provided insights into how containerd improves reliability, observability, and performance across image pulling and snapshotting operations.

Here’s what I learned:
	1.	OCI Image Volume Support (#10579)
This PR extends CRI to allow using OCI image volume sources, enabling containers to mount snapshots more flexibly. It lays the foundation for treating images as volumes with runtime-configurable access.
	2.	Sandbox Metadata Refactor (#10472)
Migrating the sandbox metadata bucket to version v1 improves the metadata schema. This is critical for keeping snapshot and diff metadata clean and extensible, especially for recovery and GC logic.
	3.	Content Creation Events (#11006)
This PR adds event hooks for when new content blobs are created. This allows the system to record usage, emit metrics, and provide better visibility into how images and layers are being consumed.
	4.	Secure Mount with Ptrace (#10611)
The mount logic now uses ptrace instead of relying on go:linkname. This enhances security and decouples Go-layer logic from syscall injection patterns, improving maintainability in the snapshot diff path.
	5.	Multipart Layer Fetch (#10177)
This change enables concurrent, chunk-based blob fetching for large OCI image layers. It directly improves the blobchain performance, reducing latency during image pulls by parallelizing downloads.

In summary, today’s PRs illustrate how containerd evolves to be more modular, safe, and efficient across its snapshot and content store subsystems. I also reinforced my understanding of how metadata structure, blob lifecycle, and instrumentation contribute to GC safety and pull performance.





非常好，以下是五个DBAB（Debug-Attach-Block）问题驱动容器调试案例的结构化 RCA 及每个的英文叙述，便于你进行系统回顾与口语训练：

⸻

DBAB Case 1: Container shows Unknown state; shim exited with code 137

Root Cause Summary
	•	Symptom: Container status becomes Unknown; containerd-shim exits with code 137.
	•	Probable Causes:
	•	OOM kill from kernel.
	•	Cgroup memory limit hit.
	•	Manual kill -9 by user or system component.
	•	Host-level memory pressure.
	•	Verification Path:
	•	dmesg | grep -i oom
	•	crictl inspect <container>
	•	journalctl -u containerd
	•	Cross-reference timestamps in logs and metrics.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Add memory usage instrumentation per container.
	•	Adjust cgroup limits.
	•	Use oom_score_adj or memory reservation to protect shim.

RCA Practice (English)

We noticed that a container entered an Unknown state, and logs revealed that the containerd-shim process exited with code 137. This indicates a forced kill, likely due to memory exhaustion. We checked dmesg and confirmed the kernel invoked the OOM killer. The container’s memory limit was too tight, so the shim was terminated. We fixed the issue by adjusting the cgroup memory settings and added memory usage metrics for early warning.

DBAB Case 2: Snapshot is not collected after container deletion

Root Cause Summary
	•	Symptom: Deleted containers leave behind snapshot data in /var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs/snapshots/
	•	Probable Causes:
	•	GC not triggered due to missing or incorrect lease reference.
	•	Snapshot is still referenced by image or another container.
	•	Failed recovery after crash — GC metadata inconsistency.
	•	Verification Path:
	•	ctr snapshot ls
	•	Check snapshot leases via ctr leases ls
	•	Inspect container metadata
	•	ls -lh snapshot directory and cross-check inode refs.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Add log/metrics for snapshot GC events.
	•	Ensure all snapshots are tied to proper leases.
	•	Add retry with exponential backoff for GC triggers.

RCA Practice (English)

After deleting several containers, we noticed the snapshot directory size kept growing. Investigation showed that the snapshot GC didn’t collect these layers. On checking the metadata, we found the snapshots weren’t tied to active leases. It likely happened due to improper recovery from an earlier crash. We added logging around snapshot collection, validated lease consistency, and enforced lease binding during container lifecycle events.

DBAB Case 3: Container stuck in Created status and never starts

Root Cause Summary
	•	Symptom: Container remains in Created state, never transitions to Running.
	•	Probable Causes:
	•	OCI runtime failed silently.
	•	Snapshot mount failed (e.g., overlayfs invalid argument).
	•	Missing shim or shim crash during start.
	•	Misconfigured runtime class or broken runtime plugin.
	•	Verification Path:
	•	journalctl -u containerd
	•	strace or enable debug logs during containerd startup
	•	Inspect container’s task start phase via crictl inspect
	•	Test mounting manually via mount -t overlay
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Add readiness checks on runtime plugin and shim.
	•	Improve logs for container start transitions.
	•	Add fallback/clean rollback if start fails.

RCA Practice (English)

A container was stuck in the Created phase without progressing to Running. Logs showed no obvious error, but when we enabled debug mode, we saw a mount overlay: invalid argument error. It turned out that the overlay mount path had stale or missing workdir. We confirmed this by manually testing the mount operation. After fixing the upper/lower/work directory integrity and cleaning stale paths, the container started normally.

⸻

DBAB Case 4: Container is running but DNS resolution fails

Root Cause Summary
	•	Symptom: nslookup or ping to domain name fails inside container.
	•	Probable Causes:
	•	resolv.conf in container not mounted properly.
	•	iptables rules (e.g., NAT or DNS masquerade) misconfigured.
	•	Host network misconfigured, CNI plugin error.
	•	Verification Path:
	•	cat /etc/resolv.conf inside container
	•	ip netns exec and run DNS tests (e.g., dig, curl)
	•	iptables -L -v -n | grep DNS
	•	Check CNI config under /etc/cni/net.d
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Validate kubelet and CNI plugin configurations.
	•	Add network health checks as readiness probe.
	•	Auto-reconcile resolv.conf and DNS rules via CNI restart logic.

RCA Practice (English)

Although the container was running, it couldn’t resolve any hostnames. We checked inside and found that /etc/resolv.conf pointed to a broken or empty config. Further debugging showed that the CNI plugin failed to mount the correct DNS settings. We re-applied the correct CNI configuration and restarted the container, which fixed the resolution issue. We also added health probes to detect such failures earlier.

⸻

DBAB Case 5: Frequent registry blob download causing cost spikes

Root Cause Summary
	•	Symptom: Registry shows frequent access to the same blob layers, increasing bandwidth and S3 usage.
	•	Probable Causes:
	•	Lack of local blob cache.
	•	Deduplication not working as digest not verified.
	•	Hot layers not stored in persistent cache.
	•	Verification Path:
	•	Enable registry access logs.
	•	Add digest instrumentation in pull path.
	•	Compare blob pull frequencies by time window (7/30 days).
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Add a blob digest registry cache with TTL.
	•	Use frequency-based tiering (S3 Standard vs. Glacier).
	•	Add pull metrics tagged with blob digests and timestamps.

RCA Practice (English)

We noticed a spike in our S3 and registry bandwidth costs. By analyzing logs and metrics, we found certain image blobs were pulled thousands of times per day. The root cause was the lack of a persistent blob cache. We implemented a digest-aware caching layer and stored frequently accessed blobs locally. We also added pull counters and digest tags to track hot vs. cold data, and downgraded rarely accessed blobs to S3 Glacier for cost savings.
