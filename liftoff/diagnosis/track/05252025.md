Simulated Results: Comparing Working vs Failing Container

[1] Network Namespace Check

Working Container

$ nsenter -n -t 1234 ip addr
eth0@if7: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    inet 10.244.1.5/24 brd 10.244.1.255 scope global eth0
    valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

$ nsenter -n -t 1234 ip route
default via 10.244.1.1 dev eth0

Failing Container

$ nsenter -n -t 4321 ip addr
eth0@if8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    inet 10.244.1.22/24 brd 10.244.1.255 scope global eth0

$ nsenter -n -t 4321 ip route
(no output)

→ Missing default route, indicating a broken or incomplete network config

⸻

[2] Bridge Device Check (host side)

$ brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
cni0            8000.1a2b3c4d5e6f       no              veth7ab1c12
                                                    vethd912a12

Observation:
	•	veth7ab1c12 (working) and vethd912a12 (failing) are both present
	•	But:

$ ip link show vethd912a12
state DOWN

→ Failing container’s veth pair is down on the host bridge

⸻

[3] iptables NAT/DNAT Check

$ iptables -t nat -L -n --line-numbers | grep 10.244.1
10   MASQUERADE  all  --  10.244.0.0/16        0.0.0.0/0
15   DNAT        tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            10.244.1.22  tcp dpt:8080 to:127.0.0.1:12345

	•	The DNAT rule for the failing container routes to localhost, which isolates it from the outside world
	•	Working container has:

# no DNAT entry


⸻

[4] iptables-save snippet

Working

-A POSTROUTING -s 10.244.1.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

Failing

-A POSTROUTING -s 10.244.1.22/32 -j RETURN

→ This rule prevents masquerading for the broken container — likely inserted by a misconfigured script

⸻

[5] kubelet/CNI Logs

$ journalctl -u kubelet | grep CNI
May 26 05:04:12 kubelet[2500]: CNI ADD for pod abc123
May 26 05:04:12 kubelet[2500]: Error executing plugin "bridge": failed to configure IP routes

$ cat /var/log/containers/containerd-network.log
[error] failed to apply default route for container 10.244.1.22: route already exists

→ Indicates CNI plugin tried to configure route, failed silently, and left the container with no default route

⸻

Diagnosis Summary

The failing container is missing its default route in the network namespace.
Its veth is down on the host bridge, and a manual DNAT + RETURN iptables rule has been inserted that blocks outbound masquerading.
Kubelet logs confirm a failure to apply routes via the bridge CNI plugin. This explains why it appears Running but has no external reachability.

Would you like me to now simulate the English RCA escalation message you’d send or say during an incident call? Or shall we move on to Module 2: Code Refined RCA Summary (English)

Our investigation shows that the affected containers are missing default routing rules in their network namespaces, which breaks outbound connectivity.

We found that the corresponding veth pair for the failing container is down on the host bridge.

In addition, iptables inspection reveals a manually inserted DNAT rule that incorrectly routes the container’s outbound traffic to 127.0.0.1, effectively isolating it from the external network.

We also noticed a RETURN rule in the POSTROUTING chain, which bypasses masquerading for this container’s subnet. This blocks dynamic SNAT behavior needed for external communication.

Logs from the CNI plugin and kubelet show failures in route injection during container setup — likely due to a preexisting conflicting route or an incomplete teardown from a previous pod.

In summary, the container appears Running but lacks outbound reachability due to:
	•	A missing default route in the namespace
	•	A downed veth interface
	•	Misconfigured DNAT and SNAT rules

We recommend flushing the affected NAT rules and reapplying the CNI plugin to restore network Great — let’s move into Module 2: Code Review Simulation, focusing on structure, risk recognition, and feedback phrasing.

Module 2: Code Review Simulation — Containerd GC Refactor

Background

You’re reviewing a PR in containerd that refactors the lease-collection logic in the garbage collector (GC).
Previously, all lease roots were collected inline in the Run() method.
Now, the contributor introduces a new function:

func collectLeaseRoots(ctx context.Context, db *bolt.DB) ([]string, error)

This function is called inside GC before root scan begins.

⸻

Your Code Review Objectives

A. Functional Parity Check
	•	Does collectLeaseRoots() handle the same cases as before?
	•	Expired leases?
	•	Still-referenced roots?
	•	Invalid metadata entries?

B. Risk Check
	•	What happens if DB read fails in collectLeaseRoots()?
	•	Does the GC exit, retry, or silently continue?

C. Metric Impact
	•	Are metrics like gc.leases.scan.duration still recorded?
	•	Does the new function add or remove log visibility?

D. Test Coverage
	•	Any unit tests added for the new function?
	•	Edge case: what if 2 leases are partially expired?

E. Concurrency / Locking
	•	Did this function move DB locks to a broader scope?
	•	Is there any defer missed inside the function?

⸻

Your Review Feedback (Structured + English Practice)

Try reading this aloud as your code comment:

“Thanks for the clean refactor — pulling the lease root scan into a separate function makes GC logic more readable.

One question: does collectLeaseRoots() still guard against expired or orphaned leases like before?

Also, in the prior version, we had a gc.leases.scan.duration metric — could we keep that around the new function?

Lastly, do you think we need a retry or fallback in case the DB read fails during collection?”

⸻

Extra Reviewer Context (for your internal checklist)
	•	In containerd, lease roots prevent snapshots and content blobs from being garbage collected.
	•	GC relies heavily on accurate root identification, so if this function returns incomplete results, valid data could be deleted.
	•	Any refactor here must preserve correctness before performance.

⸻

Would you like me to simulate a diff snippet of the PR and let you practice reviewing it line-by-line? Or shall we move on to Module 3: English Expression – Manager Communication Prompt?


Absolutely — here’s a before vs. after comparison of the collectLeaseRoots() logic, focusing specifically on handling the “silent failure” risk you identified.

⸻

BEFORE: Unsafe — Silent Failure Risk

func collectLeaseRoots(ctx context.Context, db *bolt.DB) ([]string, error) {
    var roots []string

    err := db.View(func(tx *bolt.Tx) error {
        b := tx.Bucket([]byte("leases"))
        if b == nil {
            return nil
        }
        c := b.Cursor()
        for k, v := c.First(); k != nil; k, v = c.Next() {
            lease, err := parseLease(v)
            if err != nil {
                log.G(ctx).WithError(err).Warnf("failed to parse lease %s", string(k))
                continue
            }
            if !lease.Expired() {
                roots = append(roots, lease.Root)
            }
        }
        return nil
    })

    return roots, err
}

Problems in the “Before” Version:
	•	If DB access fails, it returns an error — fine.
	•	If parsing fails repeatedly, it silently skips leases → root list may be empty.
	•	No guarantee that GC stops if roots is empty.
	•	No parse failure counter or safety threshold.
	•	Downstream GC logic may misbehave due to an empty root list.

⸻

AFTER: Hardened – Safe Guardrails Added

func collectLeaseRoots(ctx context.Context, db *bolt.DB) ([]string, error) {
    var roots []string
    var parseFailures int

    err := db.View(func(tx *bolt.Tx) error {
        b := tx.Bucket([]byte("leases"))
        if b == nil {
            return nil
        }
        c := b.Cursor()
        for k, v := c.First(); k != nil; k, v = c.Next() {
            lease, err := parseLease(v)
            if err != nil {
                parseFailures++
                log.G(ctx).WithError(err).Warnf("failed to parse lease %s", string(k))
                continue
            }
            if !lease.Expired() {
                roots = append(roots, lease.Root)
            }
        }
        return nil
    })

    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read leases from DB: %w", err)
    }

    if parseFailures > 5 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("too many lease parse failures (%d), aborting", parseFailures)
    }

    if len(roots) == 0 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("no lease roots found — possible data inconsistency, skipping GC")
    }

    return roots, nil
}

Improvements in the “After” Version:
	•	Parse failure counter added to detect degraded behavior
	•	Threshold-based abort if too many corrupted leases are seen
	•	Empty root list guard to prevent running GC on empty input
	•	All failure modes return errors up to GC layer — no silent fallback

⸻

Bonus (Optional): GC call site safety

roots, err := collectLeaseRoots(ctx, db)
if err != nil {
    log.G(ctx).WithError(err).Error("GC lease root collection failed, aborting run")
    return
}
