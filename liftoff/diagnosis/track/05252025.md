Simulated Results: Comparing Working vs Failing Container

[1] Network Namespace Check

Working Container

$ nsenter -n -t 1234 ip addr
eth0@if7: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    inet 10.244.1.5/24 brd 10.244.1.255 scope global eth0
    valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

$ nsenter -n -t 1234 ip route
default via 10.244.1.1 dev eth0

Failing Container

$ nsenter -n -t 4321 ip addr
eth0@if8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    inet 10.244.1.22/24 brd 10.244.1.255 scope global eth0

$ nsenter -n -t 4321 ip route
(no output)

→ Missing default route, indicating a broken or incomplete network config

⸻

[2] Bridge Device Check (host side)

$ brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
cni0            8000.1a2b3c4d5e6f       no              veth7ab1c12
                                                    vethd912a12

Observation:
	•	veth7ab1c12 (working) and vethd912a12 (failing) are both present
	•	But:

$ ip link show vethd912a12
state DOWN

→ Failing container’s veth pair is down on the host bridge

⸻

[3] iptables NAT/DNAT Check

$ iptables -t nat -L -n --line-numbers | grep 10.244.1
10   MASQUERADE  all  --  10.244.0.0/16        0.0.0.0/0
15   DNAT        tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            10.244.1.22  tcp dpt:8080 to:127.0.0.1:12345

	•	The DNAT rule for the failing container routes to localhost, which isolates it from the outside world
	•	Working container has:

# no DNAT entry


⸻

[4] iptables-save snippet

Working

-A POSTROUTING -s 10.244.1.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

Failing

-A POSTROUTING -s 10.244.1.22/32 -j RETURN

→ This rule prevents masquerading for the broken container — likely inserted by a misconfigured script

⸻

[5] kubelet/CNI Logs

$ journalctl -u kubelet | grep CNI
May 26 05:04:12 kubelet[2500]: CNI ADD for pod abc123
May 26 05:04:12 kubelet[2500]: Error executing plugin "bridge": failed to configure IP routes

$ cat /var/log/containers/containerd-network.log
[error] failed to apply default route for container 10.244.1.22: route already exists

→ Indicates CNI plugin tried to configure route, failed silently, and left the container with no default route

⸻

Diagnosis Summary

The failing container is missing its default route in the network namespace.
Its veth is down on the host bridge, and a manual DNAT + RETURN iptables rule has been inserted that blocks outbound masquerading.
Kubelet logs confirm a failure to apply routes via the bridge CNI plugin. This explains why it appears Running but has no external reachability.

Would you like me to now simulate the English RCA escalation message you’d send or say during an incident call? Or shall we move on to Module 2: Code Refined RCA Summary (English)

Our investigation shows that the affected containers are missing default routing rules in their network namespaces, which breaks outbound connectivity.

We found that the corresponding veth pair for the failing container is down on the host bridge.

In addition, iptables inspection reveals a manually inserted DNAT rule that incorrectly routes the container’s outbound traffic to 127.0.0.1, effectively isolating it from the external network.

We also noticed a RETURN rule in the POSTROUTING chain, which bypasses masquerading for this container’s subnet. This blocks dynamic SNAT behavior needed for external communication.

Logs from the CNI plugin and kubelet show failures in route injection during container setup — likely due to a preexisting conflicting route or an incomplete teardown from a previous pod.

In summary, the container appears Running but lacks outbound reachability due to:
	•	A missing default route in the namespace
	•	A downed veth interface
	•	Misconfigured DNAT and SNAT rules

We recommend flushing the affected NAT rules and reapplying the CNI plugin to restore network connectivity.
