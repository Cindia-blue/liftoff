## Module 1: System Debug – Container Stuck in CREATED State

**Symptom:**
- Container stuck in `CREATED`
- Repeated log: `failed to start shim`
- `address` socket file exists
- Retry still fails; containerd treats it as active

**Debug Strategy:**
1. Verify if shim process exists using `ps`, `ls -l`, `strace`
2. Inspect `/run/containerd/.../config.json` to confirm OCI spec validity
3. Use `journalctl`, `dmesg`, or SELinux audit to check shim launch failure

**Actionable Fix:**
- Cleanup container task + metadata:
  ```bash
  ctr task kill <id>
  ctr task delete <id>
  ctr container delete <id>
  rm -rf /run/containerd/.../address
  ```
- If necessary: `systemctl restart containerd`

**Summary Statement:**
> We suspect stale shim metadata and socket artifact blocked container from moving to RUNNING. We'll validate shim state, config spec, and clean up socket references accordingly.

## Module 2: Code Review – Unsafe goroutine in Snapshot Cleanup

**Risk Identified:**
- Unbounded goroutine without context
- No error feedback or retry logic
- May cause undiagnosed failures

**Suggested Fix:**
- Context-aware goroutine
- Add retry with backoff
- Log/metrics for observability

**Review Comment:**
> This code runs a filesystem cleanup in an unbounded goroutine... As-is, this cleanup approach may silently fail in edge cases and accumulate technical debt.

## Module 3: English Expression – Technical Ownership vs Rollout Priority

**User Expression:**
> As a development team, we support the feature rollout technically, but strategy and scheduling should be decided by PMs closer to customers and stakeholders.

**Refined:**
> From the engineering side, we're fully able to support the rollout... We're happy to execute based on the priorities you define.

## Module 4: System Design – Cross-Cluster Image Dump Optimization

**Goals:**
- Avoid blob duplication
- Enable incremental upload
- Minimize EBS IO
- Improve upload reliability

**Key Design Elements:**
1. Digest-based deduplication using metastore
2. Batch registry check before PUT
3. Use local bucket as buffer to offload EBS
4. Content-addressable write with digest lock
5. Add observability metrics for transfer success/failure

**Refined Summary:**
> We leverage digest-based registry + local buffering to reduce redundant S3 PUTs and EBS reads. This ensures cost control, concurrency safety, and scalable reliability.
