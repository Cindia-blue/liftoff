Daily Technical Training – 2025-05-15

Module 1: System Debug – TransferService Blob Deduplication Analysis

Problem Statement:

When importing OCI tar.gz images via TransferService in multithreaded mode, duplicate blob writes were observed — specifically, the same blob being repeatedly written into snapshots and triggering multiple snapshot.Prepare() calls.

Key Reasoning Path:

We suspect deduplication failed not at the snapshotter level, but during ingestion planning. Instrumentation is planned at:
	•	stepshelter.go: log blob digest registration into dedup map
	•	snapshot.Prepare: log mount key and invocation count
	•	contentStore.Write: log final blob write path

Summarized Diagnostic Strategy:

I suspect that deduplication failed not at the snapshotter level, but earlier during the ingestion planning phase. If the ingestion layer fails to recognize the blob as already present, it will redundantly prepare and write again.

Instrumentation points:
	•	StepShelter: log when blob digest is registered
	•	snapshot.Prepare: log mount path creation for the same digest
	•	contentStore.Write: log digest on write attempt

If the same blob digest appears in multiple Prepare() calls, deduplication has failed; otherwise, suspect content store integrity logic.

Module 2: Code Review – Retry Goroutine Safety in TransferService

PR Context:

A new patch wraps ts.Push(ctx, desc) inside a goroutine and uses retry.Do() to handle transient failures.

go func() {
   retry.Do(func() error {
       return ts.Push(ctx, desc)
   })
}()

Concerns Identified:
	•	The goroutine may leak if ts.Push does not respect ctx.Done().
	•	Retry logic lacks bounds or backoff.
	•	All errors are retried, including non-retryable 4xx errors.

Suggested Review Comment:

The current goroutine-based retry logic may leak resources under the following conditions:
1. If `ts.Push()` does not respond to `ctx.Done()`, the goroutine may never exit.
2. There’s no limit on retry attempts or delay backoff.
3. Retry is performed for all errors, including non-transient ones (e.g. 404).

Suggested Improvements:
- Ensure `ts.Push()` is context-aware.
- Limit retry attempts or use exponential backoff.
- Filter retryable errors (network timeout, 5xx).
- Add structured logs for retry start, fail, abort.
- Optionally trace goroutine lifecycle for observability.

Module 3: English Communication – Structured Pushback in Review

Scenario:

A teammate argues:

“But we need to ensure retry happens quickly. If we delay or limit retries, we may fail to recover in time.”

Your Structured Response:

We absolutely agree that retries should happen promptly to ensure timely recovery.
However, the current implementation carries a risk of unbounded retries and potentially untracked goroutines, which can lead to resource leaks or system instability.

To strike a better balance, we suggest:
	•	Adding exponential backoff
	•	Making the retry context-aware
	•	Introducing a circuit breaker to stop retries after a threshold

Follow-up Answer (Backoff justification):

That’s a great point — for transient network errors, retries can help.
But without backoff, rapid-fire retries might actually worsen network congestion or overload dependent services.
Exponential backoff increases the chance of successful recovery without overwhelming the system.

Module 4: System Design + AWS Cost Strategy – Blob Upload Optimization

Design Goals:
	•	Deduplicate blob uploads across threads and regions
	•	Reduce S3 PUT cost and cross-region traffic
	•	Enable efficient reuse across multi-region clusters

Core Design Summary:

We can calculate a digest (e.g., SHA256) for each blob and treat it as a unique key.
Since S3 supports eventual consistency and idempotent PUT operations, we don’t need a distributed lock.
Each thread can check digest existence in a metastore (e.g. Redis, DynamoDB), do batch lookups, and only upload missing blobs.
After uploading, register the blob digest to avoid future uploads.

For multi-region reuse:
	•	Option 1: Use S3 CRR for automatic cross-region blob sync (higher cost, simpler ops)
	•	Option 2: Use region-local blob buckets and lazy fetch fallback to minimize cross-region data transfer
